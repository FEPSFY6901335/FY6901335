      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        Earth-based industrial manufacturing is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, resource depletion, and habitat destruction. This article discusses the potential of space-based manufacturing to mitigate these impacts by relocating heavy industry to orbit. By leveraging government support and space resources, this approach could lead to significant environmental benefits. Key challenges, such as resource costs and long-term equipment maintenance, are explored alongside potential solutions like reusable rockets and precision manufacturing. The findings highlight the impact that industrial practices have on the Earth's climate which emphasises the need for further research, investment, and innovation.

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Industrial manufacturing processes are the largest producer of greenhouse gases on Earth. This planet currently faces a direct path to industrial pollution, resource depletion, and habitat destruction.
        In this paper, the concept of moving heavy industry into space will be explored where the potential to improve the climate will be discussed throughout. By relocating heavy industry to space, we can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions on Earth, as manufacturing processes would no longer contribute to atmospheric pollution. Additionally, this shift could help preserve valuable natural resources and habitats by minimising the need for resource extraction and land use on our planet. This approach also opens up new opportunities for utilising space-based resources and energy, potentially leading to more sustainable industrial practices.
        The paper begins by analysing current manufacturing-related climate impacts, followed by a discussion of future environmental outcomes. We will briefly discuss natural habitat restoration due to significant results from performing industrial processes in space.

        <h4>Government agency support for space manufacturing</h4>
        <p>
          Space-based agencies such as NASA are focused on developing the commercial space industry, where technologies and methodologies are lower cost and more accessible in a rapidly growing market (Taylor, 2021). Support from such impactful agencies is significant as it aids in reducing Earth's industrial impact through space-based alternatives.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Resource costs for transporting materials between Earth and space</h4>
        <p>
          The mission to move heavy industry into space comes with many economical and ethical issues such as costs and planning. Generally, manufacturing is a very attentive industry and so having it performed in space will require more attention to costs. Transporting large masses of materials to factories in space will be expensive and require extensive planning in advance to accommodate for faults and damages (Taylor, 2021). Additionally, along with the high costs, leaving the Earth's surface will heavily impact the climate since it will be done often. This concept counters the mission to reduce harmful emissions from the manufacturing industry. There is research into solutions to make this concept less environmentally harmful such as reusable rockets (Hammond, 2000), which can lower resource demands and emissions per launch. Suggestions of performing tradeoffs with rockets (Hammond, 2000) have been explored where the idea of a transportation system links with another system already in orbit to trade materials; the system will then move into deep space. This concept is ideal as the initial rocket will use less fuel since it doesn't need to fully exit Earth's orbit.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Maintenance and long-term equipment use in deep space</h4>
        <p>
          Sending equipment and systems, used to manufacture products, into space will involve logistical challenges. To ensure systems are working correctly, routine checks will be required as well as specialised workers who are trained properly. Maintaining this equipment will call for years-long missions into deep space (Taylor, 2021). There are potential solutions to avoid sending scientists into deep space in order to maintain equipment such as creating robots that will perform actions based on commands sent from the surface of Earth. As space manufacturing is a long-term process, designing an effective plan to maintain the equipment being used will be necessary.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Potential environmental benefits: reduced waste and habitat conservation</h4>
        <p>
          The mission of moving heavy industry into deep space will improve resource efficiency and waste reduction. Traditional manufacturing processes often involve producing excess materials in the event of defects or errors during production. These excess materials can lead to wasted resources as well as additional disposal costs (C. M., 2023). With precision manufacturing such as 3D printing, waste will be reduced as resources will be used more efficiently. The concept of extraterrestrial mining is a widely considered option as it could minimise the need for Earth-based extraction. This hypothetical process involves the extraction and utilisation of materials from resources in space. In theory, this idea will significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels and habitat destruction. Currently, mining has negative impacts by loss of vegetation cover, mass destruction of water bodies, loss of biodiversity, land-use changes and food insecurity, increased social vices and conflicts, high cost of living, and air pollution (Worlanyo and Jiangfeng, 2020). These impacts reinforce the environmental value of relocating resource-intensive processes off-planet.

          The breakdown of the industrial sector highlights which sub-sectors are more contributing to the global 
          emission of greenhouse gases. Comparing the industrial sector to the remaining contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, 
          29.4% of greenhouse gas emissions come from the processes involved in that sector (Ritchie, 2020).

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          A transition to space-based manufacturing processes presents promising opportunities for the climate to recover on Earth. By relocating heavy industrial processes off the planet's surface, there is a chance to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, conserve natural resources, and minimise waste production. Moreover, the conservation of habitats would result in cleaner bodies of water and a decrease in deforestation. The statistics that show global greenhouse gas emissions in the industrial sector are further proof that more research and innovation needs to go into the implementation of space manufacturing; opening up a path toward sustainable industrial practices. The practical implementation of these concepts will be challenging. High resource costs for transporting materials and long-term maintenance of equipment highlight the need for further research and innovation in efficient launch technologies and durable infrastructure. With support from government agencies like NASA, space manufacturing could mitigate climate change and inspire a new era of industrial progress.
